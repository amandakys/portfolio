## PROJECTS

Details about these projects have been withheld to comply with my NDA. It is also not possible for me to provide visuals of any design work.

#### REDESIGNING A WEB APP

The aim of this project was to improve load times for the Console, a web app used by SpatialOS developers to manage their cloud deployments.

The current web app had poor loading times for users with large numbers of deployments because the API used did not page data, instead waiting to receive one large segment of data before loading the page.

New APIs had been built, and our team was tasked with reimplementing the web app to hit these APIs, focusing on ensuring that it would still work well when users had 10,000 deployments.

A structural redesign of the sitemap was also needed to reflect changes in how the API stored deployment data.

#### SCALABLE SEARCH

Following the redesign of the Console to support large numbers of deployments, a need for the ability to search and filter these deployments quickly became evident.

I worked with the API team to design compatible server side filtering functionality. I researched and designed the UI for basic and advanced search. I also implemented the feature and managed the internal and external release to users.
