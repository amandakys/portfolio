## MY ROLE

_The Interview_ was first performed after being selected as Imperial College's submission to the London Student Drama Festival 2018. It then received support to be the Imperial College Dramatic Society's Edinburgh Fringe show for the year. I then extended the 25 minute script to 50 minutes with 3 additional cast.

I directed both versions with the help of a co-director, designed and provided the tech for the 6-show fringe run. I also produced the show, managing set transport, cast accomodation and venue hire. In my role as publicity officer was also responsible for designing the <a href="#publicity" style="white-space: nowrap">publicity material</a> material and social media presence for the show.

## SYNOPSIS

In a comic exploration of the disjoint between what we think and what we say, _The Interview_ questions how our actions ultimately influence what we think we deserve. In an interview waiting room. Alex grapples with the sudden appearance of his subconscious as a walking, talking sarcastic bundle of joy. While he waits, the conversation touches on drugs, religion and polygamy, all curiously relevant to Alex’s life. Amidst the little details, he soon realises the interview he is waiting for may not be quite as it seems.

Influenced by the ideas of existentialism and the writings of Jean Paul Sartre and Samuel Beckett, _The Interview_ is an absurdist social commentary on the effects of liberalism on the ethics and morality of our everyday lives. Highlighting the many hypocrisies we happily accept in our personal and professional lives. How can we know if we’re living life right?
