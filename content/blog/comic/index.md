After graduating from university and entering full time work, I found myself with an abundance of free time, a luxury I was not used to. I was able to take up a variety of hobbies like drumming, climbing and social ping pong with friends.

I was also overwhelmed by the realities of adult life, bills and the london rental market to name a few. My navigation of these were unsurprisingly an entertaining mess. So... I decided to document my experiences and the funny thoughts that occured with them in a series of illustrations.
