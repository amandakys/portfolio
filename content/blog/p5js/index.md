Inspired by the creative coding community on Instagram ([@zach.lieberman](https://www.instagram.com/zach.lieberman/), [@kiyoshinakauchi](https://www.instagram.com/kiyoshinakauchi/)), I wanted to learn to use a creative coding framework like openFrameworks. I found openFrameworks very difficult to set up on my machine, and further investigation led me to sketch.js and p5.js. These were much easier to use with the added bonus of being written in javascript, a language I was familiar with.

The community on codepen.io was very helpful for finding inspiration, and looking at other people's work and code really helped me understand what was possible and how to get started.
